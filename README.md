# tensorflow-work

This repository contains recent notebooks for my work on completing the official TensorFlow certification.

> On my first _**ever**_ visit to the web page at www.TensorFlow.org/certificate, I remember being ecstatic to see that there was **finally** an official certification for the technology, and I began working on achieving it.  I did research and scholarship to verify _**all of the content**_ and _**all of the work**_ required to pass the exam, without actually taking the exam and paying the fee, and then did that work, and this repository is the result.

<!---## The official TensorFlow Certificate is gold here

This is important, so ALL of the arguments here revolve around convincing you that 1. the certification itself is important and good, and 2.) that I've done enough work to make the argument that while although I don't actually have the certification at this time, for all intents and purposes regarding employment, this repository and its contents are evidence enough that I practically do have the official TensorFlow Certification, at this time.

A lot of candidates may lie on their resume and put the word "TensorFlow" on it because it's a buzz word and it makes you look like cool coder and so maybe you'll  get the job.  Maybe it's a bit more humble than that, in that you honestly do have some at-home hobbyist experience with TensorFlow, getting it installed and working some little idea of your own.  Maybe you're hiring a legitimate TensorFlow engineer that has recent and long-years experience with TF for a prior company, but since the TF ecosystem and the purpose of  TF is so wide and varied, may he does indeed have extensive TensorFlow experience, he has experience in a part of TensorFlow that is **COMPLETELY DISJOINT** from what you need right now at the company.

This certification fixes that.  This is the only officially-recognized certification for the technology.  TensorFlow has changed much from 1.0 to 2.0, and the latest exams test on 2.0.  You want candidates that actually know what they are doing, and are indeed not simply putting the buzz word on their resume, and that's the intent of this repository.  Suffice it to say that intention of this section of this document is to make sure the reader understands that t the certification is importantand the rest of the document revolves around convincing you that I've done everything to reasonably attain it, short of paying the fee.--->

<!---## More Information

Coursera has a course called "Practical Tensorflow", but I've luckily discovered the one and only public GitHub repository that the course uses, and pretty much studied the contents of that repository.  This specific online course is officially referenced by the TensorFlow exam study guide.

The TensorFlow Certificate official exam guide is a 9-page PDF file, of which the "Skills checklist" section is the most important, and it is broken down into 5 parts.  The main reason in bringing this up is that it shows that I've narrowed down.  The exam guide is just like the ones in college: they tell you exactly what is going to be covered by the exam.  Just as importantly, it also tells you what NOT to learn, in order to pass the exam; this is worth noting because there is a lot of TensorFlow documentation, and so identifying what NOT to look at saves time.--->

## About the references

- _**[The Exam Guide]:**_ The official TensorFlow Certificate web page: https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate.  You start here.  Here you'll find [the 9-page exam guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/extras/cert/TF_Certificate_Candidate_Handbook.pdf).  It tells you exactly what will be covered by the exam and also everything that *won't* be covered, which is crucial.  TensorFlow has many uses and a lot of documentation about each use, **_but a large amount of that won't be on the exam_**, so identify what that is and then _only_ do that and no more than that.

- _**[The Skills Checklist]:**_ After obtaining the exam guide, the most important section is at "Exam details" -> "Skills checklist" ; it's on pages 3 through 5, and it has **FIVE** sections.  I would say that **the last THREE sections** are the most important, followed by section 2 and then one.  The first 2 sections are kind of generic about just simply *using* TensorFlow (debugging, eg.), and the last 3 sections are actually about ML and you should know and understand all of it: image classification (CNNs), natural language processing, and "time series"/sequences/predictions.  All of this is narrowing down the scope of the things/topics/issues you'll need to be concerned with for the exam.

- _**[The Guides and Tutorials]:**_ A note at the end of the "Skills checklist" section says, in short, "All knowledge tested in the exam is adequately covered in the guides and tutorials on tensorflow.org".  Very important.  The web site indeed has specific sections for both [guides](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/basics) and [tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials).  Reading a certain combination of both will make sure you pass the exam.  So I guess - according to that - you could read a certain amount of both the guides and tutorials, and you can take the exam.  The guides and tutorials are all just Python notebooks.

- _**[The online course GitHubs]:**_ But even despite the included guides and tutorials being sufficient, there is also both a [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice) course and [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-tensorflow-for-deep-learning--ud187) course that the certificate web page recommends.  They both seem to have GitHub repositories at [dlaicourse](https://github.com/lmoroney/dlaicourse) and [udacity_intro_to_tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/courses/udacity_intro_to_tensorflow_for_deep_learning).  It's just 2 Git repositories full of Python notebooks.

So it's a good amount of experimentation via the notebook files, along with a fair amount of reading and understanding, provided by the guides and tutorials, and you should be set.  You can put all these notebooks in a GitHub repo, and work with all of them via Google Colab.  So all of the work that you have to do is exactly 2 things: 1.) a good amount of reading (provided by the guides and tutorials), and 2.) lots of interactive experimentation with the \*.ipynb files.

So after reading the guides and tutorials, and going through maybe the Udacity and Coursera courses, and of course satisfying everything else in the exam guide, you can be reasonably confident that after doing these things, you have a good chance of passing the exam.  So if you go through the 80 or so Python notebooks in these 4 or so GitHub repositories, you'd be in tip top shape to pass the exam.

Then, you can collect all of those \*.ipynb files and put them in your own GitHub repository (just like this one), and then use Colab to work on all of them for free, in the cloud, through the web browser.

Make sure you go back to that Skills Checklist section and thoroughly go over each bullet point.  Remember this: that section of the exam guide has mostly bullet points in it: not paragraphs.  So make sure to make sure each one is covered, first to last.

<!---## So please hire me

You might be surprised to find that I myself **DO NOT** have a TensorFlow certification at the moment.  I can't afford (if you don't know, the exam costs exactly **$100**) the money or time right now (if you don't know, you're given 5 hours to take the exam).  However, I did the next best thing, which is to do research and narrow down, and document, what it takes to **very minimally** and **very reasonably** demonstrate that you'd done everything about successfully taking and passing the exam, except pay the fee.

If I've found the 2 GitHub URLs used behind the only 2 officially-supported Udacity/Coursera courses/specializations, and made extensive use of Colab to work very efficiently, and have dabbled in the other 20 or so official TensorFow repositories (and not just the main popular one), and I have my own datasets to work with (in addition to the ones provided built-in to TensorFlow), then I'm a worthy candidate for your company.  This is arguing that while although I don't currently actually literally have a TensorFlow Certificate right now, I've done some high-quality thought and work about it, such that I'd be a good candidate for your company.  I'm arguing to the degree that we can both agree that I *practically* have one.--->

## Additional Notes

- [TensorFlow Without A PhD](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/tensorflow-without-a-phd/) is a personally recommended GitHub repository I recommend going through to not only prepare for the exam, but is just awesome in and of itself.  It's good quality too.  There's some **good** overlap between the exam and this course.

- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) makes it very easy to do everything you need in TensorFlow, using **only** the web browser.  I have indeed dealt with the various issues regarding just installing TensorFlow, like making sure your CPU has the appropriate instruction set, managing a Python virtual environment via pip, maybe using Bazel to build it from source to build a Python wheel, etc., even Docker.  But with Colab, everything is entirely in the cloud and in the web browser, and it's free, and you can import `tensorflow as tf` and it just works.  It also integrates with GitHub very well, so it's a perfect combination for practing 100% of everything required for the exam.
