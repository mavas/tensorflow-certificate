# My Unofficial TensorFlow certification guide 2022

## About this repository

This repository is just for job-seeking purposes; it's made **ONLY** with the intent of impressing potential employers during my job-hunting this January 2022.

With that being said, an employer might care about exactly 2 pieces of value in regards to the items in this repository (there's only 2 kinds: this README.md file, and scientific notebook files):
1. recent and practical TensorFlow-specific work as exemplified by each of the Python notebooks found in this repository, and
2. I suppose a good example of professional writing.

## The official TensorFlow Certificate is gold here

This is important, so ALL of the arguments here revolve around convincing you that 1. the certification itself is important and good, and 2.) that I've done enough work to make the argument that while although I don't actually have the certification at this time, for all intents and purposes regarding employment, this repository and its contents are evidence enough that I practically do have the official TensorFlow Certification, at this time.

A lot of candidates may lie on their resume and put the word "TensorFlow" on it because it's a buzz word and it makes you look like cool coder and so maybe you'll  get the job.  Maybe it's a bit more humble than that, in that you honestly do have some at-home hobbyist experience with TensorFlow, getting it installed and working some little idea of your own.  Maybe you're hiring a legitimate TensorFlow engineer that has recent and long-years experience with TF for a prior company, but since the TF ecosystem and the purpose of  TF is so wide and varied, may he does indeed have extensive TensorFlow experience, he has experience in a part of TensorFlow that is **COMPLETELY DISJOINT** from what you need right now at the company.

This certification fixes that.  This is the only officially-recognized certification for the technology.  TensorFlow has changed much from 1.0 to 2.0, and the latest exams test on 2.0.  You want candidates that actually know what they are doing, and are indeed not simply putting the buzz word on their resume, and that's the intent of this repository.  Suffice it to say that intention of this section of this document is to make sure the reader understands that t the certification is importantand the rest of the document revolves around convincing you that I've done everything to reasonably attain it, short of paying the fee.

## More Information

This is some recent work, for a job interview purposes.  It's a collection of Python notebooks corresponding to the format used by theh official TensorFlow documentation (which is Python notebooks).

Coursera has a course called "Practical Tensorflow", but I've luckily discovered the one and only public GitHub repository that the course uses, and pretty much studied the contents of that repository.  This specific online course is officially referenced by the TensorFlow exam study guide.

The TensorFlow Certificate official exam guide is a 9-page PDF file, of which the "Skills checklist" section is the most important, and it is broken down into 5 parts.  The main reason in bringing this up is that it shows that I've narrowed down.  The exam guide is just like the ones in college: they tell you exactly what is going to be covered by the exam.  Just as importantly, it also tells you what NOT to learn, in order to pass the exam; this is worth noting because there is a lot of TensorFlow documentation, and so identifying what NOT to look at saves time.

## About the references

Each and every reference/link in this section is important, as they are the things that helped me narrow down exactly just what it is that I have to do to convince an employer that I have done enough work to say that I passed a particular exam.

- The official TensorFlow Certificate web page: https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate.  You start here.  Here you'll find [the 9-page exam guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/extras/cert/TF_Certificate_Candidate_Handbook.pdf), and even [the candidate technical guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/extras/cert/Setting_Up_TF_Developer_Certificate_Exam.pdf).  It's important to remember **official** sources, as they are an authority.  But the most important thing is the official exam guide.  This tells you exactly what will be covered by the exam and also everything that *won't* be covered, which is a crucial step.  TensorFlow has many uses and a lot of documentation about each use, but a large amount of that won't be covered by the exam, so identify what that is and then oONLY do that and no more than that.  The TensorFlow Certificate web page mentions 2 online  courses.

- The study guide, or the certificate web page, states explicitly that "everything that is covered by the exam can be found in the official TensorFlow guides and tutorials.  Also, though, the exam guide specifies CNNs, natural language processing, and time series enalysis.

- There are 2 officially recognized/referred online courses, regarding the TensorFlow: the one from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice#courses), and the one from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-tensorflow-for-deep-learning--ud187).  The GitHub repository locations, that I've discovered, associated with these 2 courses, are https://github.com/lmoroney/dlaicourse, and https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/courses/udacity_intro_to_tensorflow_for_deep_learning.

- [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com) has made it very easy to do everything you need in TensorFlow, using only the web browser.  I have indeed dealt with the various issues regarding just installing TensorFlow, like making sure your CPU has the appropriate instruction set (b/c TensorFlow simply will not work unless it's there), maybe managing a Python virtual environment via pip, maybe using Bazel to build it from source to build a Python wheel, etc., whatever.  But with Colab, everything is entirely in the web browser, and you can import TensorFlow and it just works.  It also integrates with GitHub very well, so it's a perfect combination for presenting a resume and keeping this repository updated.

## So please hire me

You might be surprised to find that I myself **DO NOT** have a TensorFlow certification at the moment.  I can't afford (if you don't know, the exam costs exactly **$100**) the money or time right now (if you don't know, you're given 5 hours to take the exam).  However, I did the next best thing, which is to do research and narrow down, and document, what it takes to **very minimally** and **very reasonably** demonstrate that you'd done everything about successfully taking and passing the exam, except pay the fee.

If I've found the 2 GitHub URLs used behind the only 2 officially-supported Udacity/Coursera courses/specializations, and made extensive use of Colab to work very efficiently, and have dabbled in the other 20 or so official TensorFow repositories (and not just the main popular one), and I have my own datasets to work with (in addition to the ones provided built-in to TensorFlow), then I'm a worthy candidate for your company.  This is arguing that while although I don't currently actually literally have a TensorFlow Certificate right now, I've done some high-quality thought and work about it, such that I'd be a good candidate for your company.  I'm arguing to the degree that we can both agree that I *practically* have one.

### Disclaimer

- While indeed this document might come across as having the features of a study guide, it is indeed instead being specifically tailored for any prospective employer who wants to review my GitHub for material used in consideration of highering me for a job in the near future.
- I've also dealt with lesser known but still officially-supported high-level GitHub repositories on the official GitHub TensorFlow project page.  Good developers know the difference between this URL and this directory, with all of the plentiful and beautiful TensorFlow projects. https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/README.md, graphics, gan, datasets, models, tensorboard, probability.  **NONE** of these repositories are covered by the exam.

- [TensorFlow Without A PhD](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/tensorflow-without-a-phd/) is personally recommended GitHub repository I recommend going through to not only prepare for the exam (it coincidently-enough has some content that overlaps with the exam's contents), but is just awesome in and of itself.  It's of high quality too.
