# tensorflow-work

This repository contains recent notebooks for my work on completing the official TensorFlow certification.

> On my first _**ever**_ visit to the web page at www.TensorFlow.org/certificate, I remember being ecstatic to see that there was **finally** an official certification for the technology, and I began working on achieving it.  I did research and scholarship to verify _**all of the content**_ and _**all of the work**_ required to pass the exam, without actually taking the exam or paying the fee, and then did that work, and this repository is the result.

<!---## The official TensorFlow Certificate is gold here

This is important, so ALL of the arguments here revolve around convincing you that 1. the certification itself is important and good, and 2.) that I've done enough work to make the argument that while although I don't actually have the certification at this time, for all intents and purposes regarding employment, this repository and its contents are evidence enough that I practically do have the official TensorFlow Certification, at this time.

A lot of candidates may lie on their resume and put the word "TensorFlow" on it because it's a buzz word and it makes you look like cool coder and so maybe you'll  get the job.  Maybe it's a bit more humble than that, in that you honestly do have some at-home hobbyist experience with TensorFlow, getting it installed and working some little idea of your own.  Maybe you're hiring a legitimate TensorFlow engineer that has recent and long-years experience with TF for a prior company, but since the TF ecosystem and the purpose of  TF is so wide and varied, may he does indeed have extensive TensorFlow experience, he has experience in a part of TensorFlow that is **COMPLETELY DISJOINT** from what you need right now at the company.

This certification fixes that.  This is the only officially-recognized certification for the technology.  TensorFlow has changed much from 1.0 to 2.0, and the latest exams test on 2.0.  You want candidates that actually know what they are doing, and are indeed not simply putting the buzz word on their resume, and that's the intent of this repository.  Suffice it to say that intention of this section of this document is to make sure the reader understands that t the certification is importantand the rest of the document revolves around convincing you that I've done everything to reasonably attain it, short of paying the fee.--->

<!---## More Information

Coursera has a course called "Practical Tensorflow", but I've luckily discovered the one and only public GitHub repository that the course uses, and pretty much studied the contents of that repository.  This specific online course is officially referenced by the TensorFlow exam study guide.

The TensorFlow Certificate official exam guide is a 9-page PDF file, of which the "Skills checklist" section is the most important, and it is broken down into 5 parts.  The main reason in bringing this up is that it shows that I've narrowed down.  The exam guide is just like the ones in college: they tell you exactly what is going to be covered by the exam.  Just as importantly, it also tells you what NOT to learn, in order to pass the exam; this is worth noting because there is a lot of TensorFlow documentation, and so identifying what NOT to look at saves time.--->

<!---## About the references

- The official TensorFlow Certificate web page: https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate.  You start here.  Here you'll find [the 9-page exam guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/extras/cert/TF_Certificate_Candidate_Handbook.pdf) \[[and even [the candidate technical guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/extras/cert/Setting_Up_TF_Developer_Certificate_Exam.pdf)\].  It tells you exactly what will be covered by the exam and also everything that *won't* be covered, which is crucial.  TensorFlow has many uses and a lot of documentation about each use, but a large amount of that won't be covered by the exam, so identify what that is and then _only_ do that and no more than that.

- The most important section to see is called "Exam details" -> "Skills checklist" ; it has five sections, lasts from page 3 to 5, and all of it is followed by an important note that I'll get back to in a minute.  The first 2 sections are kind of generic about just simply *using* TensorFlow (debugging, eg.), and the last 3 sections are some meaty and important topics: CNNs, natural language processing, and time series analysis.

- The note at the end of the "Skills checklist" section says, in short, "All knowledge tested in the exam is adequately covered in the guides and tutorials on tensorflow.org".  Very important.  The web site indeed has specific sections for both https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/basics and https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials.  Reading a certain combination of both will make sure you pass the exam.

- The web cite recommends a [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice#courses) course and an [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-tensorflow-for-deep-learning--ud187) course.  I believe that each online course has a GitHub repository, and are https://github.com/lmoroney/dlaicourse, and https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/courses/udacity_intro_to_tensorflow_for_deep_learning.

- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) has made it very easy to do everything you need in TensorFlow, using only the web browser.  I have indeed dealt with the various issues regarding just installing TensorFlow, like making sure your CPU has the appropriate instruction set, managing a Python virtual environment via pip, maybe using Bazel to build it from source to build a Python wheel, etc., even Docker.  But with Colab, everything is entirely in the cloud and in the web browser, and it's free, and you can import TensorFlow and it just works.  It also integrates with GitHub very well, so it's a perfect combination for practing 100% of everything required for the exam.--->

<!---## So please hire me

You might be surprised to find that I myself **DO NOT** have a TensorFlow certification at the moment.  I can't afford (if you don't know, the exam costs exactly **$100**) the money or time right now (if you don't know, you're given 5 hours to take the exam).  However, I did the next best thing, which is to do research and narrow down, and document, what it takes to **very minimally** and **very reasonably** demonstrate that you'd done everything about successfully taking and passing the exam, except pay the fee.

If I've found the 2 GitHub URLs used behind the only 2 officially-supported Udacity/Coursera courses/specializations, and made extensive use of Colab to work very efficiently, and have dabbled in the other 20 or so official TensorFow repositories (and not just the main popular one), and I have my own datasets to work with (in addition to the ones provided built-in to TensorFlow), then I'm a worthy candidate for your company.  This is arguing that while although I don't currently actually literally have a TensorFlow Certificate right now, I've done some high-quality thought and work about it, such that I'd be a good candidate for your company.  I'm arguing to the degree that we can both agree that I *practically* have one.--->

## Disclaimer

- [TensorFlow Without A PhD](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/tensorflow-without-a-phd/) is a personally recommended GitHub repository I recommend going through to not only prepare for the exam, but is just awesome in and of itself.  It's good quality too.  There's some **good** overlap between the exam and this course.

- TensorFlow is usually just the main repository, but there are [20+ other officially-supported repositories](https://github.com/orgs/tensorflow/repositories) and some I've worked with and I think are neat. **models** and **datasets** are pretty core; [this](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/) directory is neat.  There's also gan, graphics, and probability.  **None** of these repositories are covered by the exam.
