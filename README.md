## About this repository

This repository is just for job-seeking purposes.  It's made only with the intent of impressing potential employers during my job-hunting this January 2022.

## More Information

This is some recent work, for a job interview purposes.  It's a collection of Python notebooks corresponding to the format used by theh official TensorFlow documentation (which is Python notebooks).

Coursera has a course called "Practical Tensorflow", but I've luckily discovered the one and only public GitHub repository that the course uses, and pretty much studied the contents of that repository.  This specific online course is officially referenced by the TensorFlow exam study guide.

The TensorFlow Certificate official exam guide is a 9-page PDF file, of which the "Skills checklist" section is the most important, and it is broken down into 5 parts.  The main reason in bringing this up is that it shows that I've narrowed down.  The exam guide is just like the ones in college: they tell you exactly what is going to be covered by the exam.  Just as importantly, it also tells you what NOT to learn, in order to pass the exam; this is worth noting because there is a lot of TensorFlow documentation, and so identifying what NOT to look at saves time.

If I've found the 2 GitHub URLs used behind the only 2 officially-supported Udacity/Coursera courses/specializations, and made extensive use of Colab to work very efficiently, and have dabbled in the other 20 or so official TensorFow repositories (and not just the main popular one), and I have my own datasets to work with (in addition to the ones provided built-in to TensorFlow), then I'm a worthy candidate for your company.
